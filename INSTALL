                             Installing ufo2000.


1. General information.

Current ufo2000 version compiles and works well in UNIX and WIN32 enviroments.
Previous version could also be compiled for DOS using DJGPP and a set of
additional libraries (for more details download older sources 0.3.11 and
look for instructions there). DOS support is not a primary target now though
it still may be not completely broken. If anyone wants to reanimate
DOS support, you are welcome.

To successfully run ufo2000 you need the following:
  1) ufo2000 executable itself.
     You can download precompiled binary from ufo2000 home page or compile
     the executable using the sources wich you can get from ufo2000 homepage
     too.Instructions how to compile are at the end of this file.

  2) ufo2000 data-file package.
     This is free and can be downloaded from ufo2000 home page.

  3) Data files from 'UFO: Enemy Unknown' by Microprose.
     These files are proprietary and are not distributed with the game.
     You have to get them from somewhere else. Currently ufo2000 runs well
     with data files from 'UFO: Enemy Unknown V1.2' and 'UFO: Enemy Unknown V1.4'
     but other versions may work as well or may not.

After you get all the necessery files do the following:

  1) create a directory for ufo2000

  2) copy the executable there

  3) unpack the datapackage into that directory

  4) edit ufo2000.ini acording to your setup, be sure to enter the path to where
     you put the original 'UFO: Enemy Unknown' data files.
     For example if you have copied the files to the ufo2000 directory write
     "./" for UNIX/LINUX or ".\" for WINDOWS behind "origfiles".(the "." means
     current directory) So the whole line should look something like this:
     origfiles = ./ # put path to the original data files here.

All filenames must be converted to lowercase to avoid problems in UNIX.
You need GEODATA, GEOGRAPH, MAPS, SOUND, TERRAIN, UFOGRAPH, UFOINTRO, and UNITS
directories from 'UFO: Enemy Unknown'. Non proprietary data files from ufo2000
needed to play are the following: armoury.set, geodata.dat, items.dat,
soldier.dat, ufo2000.dat and ufo2000.ini.
Anyway if you are missing something, the program will tell you about this.


2. Compilation.

Prerequisites:
gcc 2.96.3 or later for *nix
MS Visual Studio 6.0 for Windows.

Allegro library version 4.0.x
 can be found at http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/

jpgalleg library version 2.1
 can be found at http://www.allegro.cc/depot/project.php?_id=522

Expat library 1.95.6
 can be found at http://expat.sourceforge.net/

UFO2000 sources. Either download latest release (recommended) from
http://ufo2000.sourceforge.net/ or check out latest source snapshot
from the source repository http://lxnt.info:8888/repos/ufo2k/trunk/

You will need Subversion 0.22+ client. Look at http://subversion.tigris.org/

You can also check out any release from the tags directory at
http://lxnt.info:8888/repos/ufo2k/tags/

To compile for *NIX:
  1) unpack the source somewhere
  2) change into the directory wich was created
  3) run make

You need ONLY the the ufo2000 executable from that directory

If gcc complains about expat.h :

expat.h:657: use of enum `XML_Status' without previous declaration
expat.h:736: multiple definition of `enum XML_Status'

cut the enum definition at about line 736 and paste it somewhere above
line 657.

There are three ways to compile UFO2000 for windows.
1. Compile natively. UFO2000 is known to compile with MS Visual Studio 6.0
2. Cross-compile. UFO2000 compiles well using cross-tools package. Google for it.
3. Natively compile with MinGW. UFO2000 has been compiled with MSYS 1.0.

No one tried compiling it with Cygwin. It should work.

To compile for WIN32:
  1) unpack the source somewhere
  2) open `ufo2000.dsw` from MS Visual Studio 6.0
  3) compile


3. Troubleshooting.

If you have files from old DOS version of XCOM1/UFO:EU (not the collector's
edition) then you won't be able to run UFO2000 unless you set F_FILECHECK to 0
in the ufo2000.ini file.

If you have some obscure or modified copy of the "UFO:Enemy unkown" files you
can try to keep ufo2000 from checking for these by setting "F_FILECHECK = 0".
However doing so is (not so) highly discouraged.
