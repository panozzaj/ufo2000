                             Installing ufo2000.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. General information.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current ufo2000 version compiles and works well in UNIX and WIN32 environments.
Previous version could also be compiled for DOS using DJGPP and a set of
additional libraries (for more details download older sources 0.3.11 and
look for instructions there). DOS support is not a primary target now though
it still may be not completely broken. If anyone wants to reanimate
DOS support, you are welcome.

In order to successfully run ufo2000, you need a set of data files from 
'UFO: Enemy Unknown' by Microprose. UFO2000 can also use data files from 
demo-version of this game, but you will only have a limited set of features 
available in this case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Platform-specific instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Win32 ---

1) Download the latest win32-binary distributive of ufo2000 from
   http://ufo2000.sourceforge.net or compile the game from sources 
   yourself.

   If you want to compile the sources (if you don't, just skip the rest
   of this section), it is recommended to use free MinGW compiler 
   (Win32-port of GNU C++). You may also have to install MSYS (minimalistic 
   set of unix tools) too. Both MinGW and MSYS can be downloaded from:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw

   You will also need a set of libraries. You can either compile and 
   install them yourself, or download a set of the following files and
   just extract them into directory with installed MinGW:

     http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/mingw-allegro.zip
     http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/mingw-expat.zip
     http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/mingw-hawknl.zip
     http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/mingw-lua.zip

   After you have all the libraries installed, unpack archive with
   the sources of the game, enter the directory that will be created 
   and just type 'make win32=1' from the command line.
   To compile game server, run 'make win32=1 server'

   Note: there is Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project file in the source
   distribution, but it has not been updated for a long time (I do not
   have MSVC 6.0 installed any longer --serge). The fact that it is not 
   up to date is a known problem. Please do not report it and do not 
   ask to fix it. But if you can make it work, please send an updated 
   copy to us.

2) Unpack archive with ufo2000 binary into any directory of your choice
   ('c:\games\ufo2000' for example). If you compiled the game yourself,
   you can just use the same directory that you used for compilation.

3) If you own a full version of X-COM, you can copy all the files from 
   the directory where you have X-COM: UFO Defense installed into 
   'XCOM' subdirectory of ufo2000 (it is initially empty).

4) If you do not have a full version of X-COM, you can download a freely 
   available demo from ftp://ftp.microprose.com:

     ftp://ftp.microprose.com/pub/mps-online/x-com/xcomdemo.zip

   After decompression of this file, you will get XCOM.EXE file which
   is zip self extracting archive. Run it with -d option and specify
   ufo2000 directory in a command line: 'XCOM.EXE -d c:\games\ufo2000'.

   Note: this SFX archive is a DOS executable and it can not handle
   long file names ('C:\Program Files\ufo2000' for example), in this case
   you will have to extract all the needed files using any other external
   utility and place extracted files to ufo2000 directory manually (into
   'XCOMDEMO' subdirectory, which is initially empty).

5) X-COM: Terror From the Deep data files are installed in a similar 
   way: TFTD subdirectory is used for a full version, TFTDDEMO 
   subdierectory is used for a demo version of X-COM: Terror From the Deep.
   This demo version can be downloaded here: 

     ftp://ftp.microprose.com/pub/mps-online/demos/terror.zip

--- Linux/Unix ---

1) Check if you have all the needed libraries installed and install them
   if necessery. A list of the required libraries is listed below:
   
   Allegro library version 4.0.x
     can be found at http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/
   Expat library 1.95.6
     can be found at http://expat.sourceforge.net/
   HawkNL network library 1.66
     can be found at http://www.hawksoft.com/hawknl/
   Lua scripting language and library version 5.0
     can be found at http://www.lua.org/

   If gcc complains about expat.h :

   expat.h:657: use of enum `XML_Status' without previous declaration
   expat.h:736: multiple definition of `enum XML_Status'

   cut the enum definition at about line 736 and paste it somewhere above
   line 657.

2) Download the latest sources of ufo2000, extract them into a separate 
   directory and run make (or gmake) from it:

   # make

3) If you own a full version of X-COM, you can just copy all the files
   from the installed X-COM directory into 'XCOM' subdirectory of ufo2000
   (it is initially empty)

4) If you do not have a full version of X-COM, you can download a freely 
   available demo from ftp://ftp.microprose.com:

     ftp://ftp.microprose.com/pub/mps-online/x-com/xcomdemo.zip

   After decompression of this file, you will get XCOM.EXE file which
   is zip self extracting archive. There are all the needed files for 
   ufo2000 to work inside of it. Extract them and copy into 'XCOMDEMO' 
   subdirectory of ufo2000.

5) X-COM: Terror From the Deep data files are installed in a similar 
   way: TFTD subdirectory is used for a full version, TFTDDEMO 
   subdierectory is used for a demo version of X-COM: Terror From the Deep.
   This demo version can be downloaded here: 

     ftp://ftp.microprose.com/pub/mps-online/demos/terror.zip

--- Gentoo Linux ---

There is ufo2000 ebuild available which makes installation of the game 
extremely simple. It automatically downloads XCOM and TFTD demos, compiles
the game and installs it into system. The game is immediately ready to run
after install. You may optionally copy data files from a full version of
X-COM: UFO Defense into '/usr/share/games/ufo2000/XCOM' and data files
from X-COM: Terror from the Deep to '/usr/share/games/ufo2000/TFTD' 
respectively. This will allow you to play on maps with various terrain 
types and use more different units.
