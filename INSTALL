                             Installing ufo2000.
                 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. General information.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current ufo2000 version compiles and works well in UNIX and WIN32 environments.
Previous version could also be compiled for DOS using DJGPP and a set of
additional libraries (for more details download older sources 0.3.11 and
look for instructions there). DOS support is not a primary target now though
it still may be not completely broken. If anyone wants to reanimate
DOS support, you are welcome.

The game is designed to be compatible with the graphics and other data files from 
'UFO: Enemy Unknown' by Microprose. Moreover, some time ago using these data files 
was the only way to run the game. But now we have a set of free graphics and other 
resources, so now installing and using the data files from X-COM is optional.
Having data files from X-COM and TFTD provides a lot more maps and unit skins 
for use in the game though.

-- 2. Platform-specific instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Win32 ---

1) If you don't want to compile the game yourself, please download
   the installer, run it and follow all the instructions, you should have 
   no problems

2) If you want to compile the sources (if you don't, just skip the rest
   of this section), it is recommended to use free MinGW compiler 
   (Win32-port of GNU C++). You also need to install MSYS (minimalistic 
   set of unix tools). Both MinGW and MSYS can be downloaded from:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw

   You will also need a set of libraries. You can either compile and 
   install them yourself, or download the following file and just 
   extract it into the directory with ufo2000 sources:

     http://ufo2000.xcomufo.com/files/mingw-libs.zip

   After you have all the libraries installed, unpack archive with
   the sources of the game, enter the directory that will be created 
   and just type 'make' from the command line.
   To compile game server, run 'make server'

   The sources can be also compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ with little
   or no changes. If anyone wants to join ufo2000 development team and wants
   to use MSVC IDE, please contact the developers via our mailing list, we 
   will surely help.

3) If you have a full version of X-COM, you can copy all the files from 
   the directory where you have X-COM: UFO Defense installed into 
   'XCOM' subdirectory of ufo2000 (it is initially empty).

4) X-COM: Terror From the Deep data files are installed in a similar 
   way to 'TFTD' subdirectory

--- Linux/Unix ---

1) Check if you have all the needed libraries installed and install them
   if necessery. The game requires a lot of libraries, but most of them are 
   usually already preinstalled: expat, zlib, libpng, ogg vorbis, freetype2. 
   
   Less 'standard' libraries you may have troubles with are listed below:
   
   Allegro library version 4.2.x
     can be found at http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/
   HawkNL network library 1.68
     can be found at http://www.hawksoft.com/hawknl/
   DUMB music library 0.9.2 (version 0.9.3 is not compatible with the game!)
     can be found at http://dumb.sourceforge.net/

2) Download the latest sources of ufo2000, extract them into a separate 
   directory and run make (or gmake) from it:

   # make

   For building without music support (and without the need to install DUMB library):

   # make no_dumbogg=1

3) If you have a full version of X-COM, you can copy all the files from 
   the directory where you have X-COM: UFO Defense installed into 
   'XCOM' subdirectory of ufo2000 (it is initially empty).

4) X-COM: Terror From the Deep data files are installed in a similar 
   way to 'TFTD' subdirectory

--- Gentoo Linux ---

There is ufo2000 ebuild available which makes installation of the game 
extremely simple. The game is immediately ready to run after install. 
You may optionally copy data files from a full version of X-COM: UFO Defense 
into '/usr/share/games/ufo2000/XCOM' and data files from X-COM: Terror from the Deep 
to '/usr/share/games/ufo2000/TFTD' respectively. This will allow you to play on maps 
with various terrain types and use more different units.

-- 3. Getting the latest unstable sources snapshot (for developers only)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can get the latest source snapshot from the source repository 
  https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ufo2000/trunk/

You will need Subversion 1.0+ client. Look at
  http://subversion.tigris.org/

You can also check out any release from the tags directory at
  https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ufo2000/tags/

Also if you would like to know more about taking part in the development
of the game, you are suggested to read HACKING file which is located in the
UFO2000 directory (or here: https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ufo2000/trunk/HACKING).
