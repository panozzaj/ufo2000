                             Installing ufo2000.

1. General information.

Current ufo2000 version compiles and works well in UNIX and WIN32 enviroments. 
Previous version could also be compiled for DOS using DJGPP and a set of 
additional libraries (for more details download older sources 0.3.11 and 
look for instructions there). DOS support is not a primary target now though 
it still may be not completely broken. If anyone wants to reanimate 
DOS support, you are welcome.

To successfully run ufo2000 you need the following:
  1) ufo2000 executable itself. 
     You can download precompiled binary from ufo2000 home page or compile 
     the executable using the sources wich you can get from ufo2000 homepage
     too.Instructions how to compile are at the end of this file.

  2) ufo2000 data-file package.
     This is free and can be downloaded from ufo2000 home page.

  3) Data files from 'UFO: Enemy Unknown' by Microprose.
     These files are proprietary and are not distributed with the game.
     You have to get them from somewhere else. Currently ufo2000 runs well 
     with data files from 'UFO: Enemy Unknown V1.2' and 'UFO: Enemy Unknown V1.4'
     but other versions may work as well or may not.
     
After you get all the necessery files do the following:

  1) create a directory for ufo2000

  2) copy the executable there

  3) unpack the datapackage into that directory

  4) edit ufo2000.ini acording to your setup, be sure to enter the path to where
     you put the original 'UFO: Enemy Unknown' data files.
     For example if you have copied the files to the ufo2000 directory write 
     "./" for UNIX/LINUX or ".\" for WINDOWS behind "origfiles".(the "." means
     current directory) So the whole line should look something like this:
     origfiles = ./ # put path to the original data files here.
     
All filenames must be converted to lowercase to avoid problems in UNIX. 
You need GEODATA, GEOGRAPH, MAPS, SOUND, TERRAIN, UFOGRAPH, UFOINTRO, and UNITS 
directories from 'UFO: Enemy Unknown'. Non proprietary data files from ufo2000 
needed to play are the following: armoury.set, geodata.dat, items.dat, 
soldier.dat, ufo2000.dat and ufo2000.ini.
Anyway if you are missing something, the program will tell you about this.



2. Compilation.

To compile for UNIX:
  1) install Allegro library
  2) unpack the source somewhere
  3) change into the directory wich was created
  4) run make
 
You need ONLY the the ufo2000 executable from that directory

To compile for WIN32:
  1) install Allegro library, DirectX SDK >= 6
  2) open `ufo2000.dsw` from MS Visual Studio 6.0
  3) compile

allegro:
http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/

3. Troubleshooting.

If you have some obscure or modified copy of the "UFO:Enemy unkown" files you 
can try to keep ufo2000 from checking for these by setting "F_FILECHECK = 0".
However doing so is highly discouraged.
