                             Installing ufo2000.

1. General information.

Current ufo2000 version compiles and works well in UNIX and WIN32 environments.
Previous version could also be compiled for DOS using DJGPP and a set of
additional libraries (for more details download older sources 0.3.11 and
look for instructions there). DOS support is not a primary target now though
it still may be not completely broken. If anyone wants to reanimate
DOS support, you are welcome.

In order to successfully run ufo2000, you need a set of data files from 
'UFO: Enemy Unknown' by Microprose. UFO2000 can also use data files from 
demo-version of this game, but you will only have a limited set of features 
available in this case.

2. Platform-specific instructions

--- Win32 ---

1) Download the latest win32-binary distributive of ufo2000 from
   http://ufo2000.sourceforge.net or compile the game from sources 
   yourself.

   If you want to compile the sources (if you don't, just skip the rest
   of this section), it is recommended to use free MinGW compiler 
   (Win32-port of GNU C++). You may also have to install MSYS (minimalistic 
   set of unix tools) too. Both MinGW and MSYS can be downloaded from:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw

   You will also need a set of libraries. You can either compile and 
   install them yourself, or download a set of the following files and
   just extract them into directory with installed MinGW:

     http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/mingw-allegro.zip
     http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/mingw-expat.zip
     http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/mingw-hawknl.zip
     http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/mingw-lua.zip

2) Unpack ufo2000 binary and a it into a separate directory

3) If you own a full version of X-COM, you can just copy all the files
   from the installed X-COM directory into 'XCOM' subdirectory of ufo2000
   (it is initially empty)

4) If you do not have a full version of X-COM, you can download a freely 
   available demo from ftp://ftp.microprose.com:

     ftp://ftp.microprose.com/pub/mps-online/x-com/xcomdemo.zip

   After decompression of this file, you will get XCOM.EXE file which
   is dos zip seflextracting archive. There are all the needed files for 
   ufo2000 to work inside of it. Copy them into 'XCOMDEMO' subdirectory 
   of ufo2000.

--- Linux/Unix ---

1) Check if you have all the needed libraries installed and install them
   if necessery. A list of the required libraries is listed below:
   
   Allegro library version 4.0.x
     can be found at http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/
   Expat library 1.95.6
     can be found at http://expat.sourceforge.net/
   HawkNL network library 1.66
     can be found at http://www.hawksoft.com/hawknl/
   Lua scripting language interpreter and library version 5.0
     can be found at http://www.lua.org/

   If gcc complains about expat.h :

   expat.h:657: use of enum `XML_Status' without previous declaration
   expat.h:736: multiple definition of `enum XML_Status'

   cut the enum definition at about line 736 and paste it somewhere above
   line 657.

2) Download the latest sources of ufo2000, extract them into a separate 
   directory and run make (or gmake) from it

   # make

3) If you own a full version of X-COM, you can just copy all the files
   from the installed X-COM directory into 'XCOM' subdirectory of ufo2000
   (it is initially empty)

4) If you do not have a full version of X-COM, you can download a freely 
   available demo from ftp://ftp.microprose.com:

     ftp://ftp.microprose.com/pub/mps-online/x-com/xcomdemo.zip

   After decompression of this file, you will get XCOM.EXE file which
   is dos zip seflextracting archive. There are all the needed files for 
   ufo2000 to work inside of it. Copy them into 'XCOMDEMO' subdirectory 
   of ufo2000.

3. Getting the latest unstable sources snapshot (for developers only)

You can get the latest source snapshot from the source repository 
  http://lxnt.info:8888/repos/ufo2k/trunk/

You will need Subversion 0.31.0+ client. Look at
  http://subversion.tigris.org/

You can also check out any release from the tags directory at
