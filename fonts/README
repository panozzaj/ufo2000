DejaVu fonts 1.5 (c)2004 Stepan Roh
-----------------------------------

DejaVu fonts are Bitstream Vera fonts (http://www.bitstream.com/) with
additional characters (see status.txt for more information). They are
optimized for display on Linux/X (which has some TrueType display problems),
but that should not affect their usability on other systems or in printing.

DejaVu fonts are based on Bitstream Vera fonts version 1.10.

Available fonts (Sans = sans serif, Mono = monospaced):

DejaVu Sans Mono
DejaVu Sans Mono Bold
DejaVu Sans Mono Bold Oblique
DejaVu Sans Mono Oblique
DejaVu Sans
DejaVu Sans Bold
DejaVu Sans Bold Oblique
DejaVu Sans Oblique
DejaVu Serif
DejaVu Serif Bold

For license information see LICENSE. What's new is described in NEWS. Known
bugs are in BUGS. All authors are mentioned in AUTHORS.

Fonts are published in source form as SFD files (Spline Font Database from
FontForge - http://fontforge.sf.net/) and in compiled form as TTF files
(TrueType fonts) and QPF files (Opie/Qtopia fonts; see README.qpf).
