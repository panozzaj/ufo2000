This directory contains source files taken from JPGAlleg 2.2 library
and patched to properly support loading jpg files in video modes with
8 bit color depth.

Another reason to include these source files directly into UFO2000 
source tree is that I was unable to locate JPGAlleg home page. 
I have downloaded JPGAlleg 2.2 sources using a link found somewhere
on http://allegro.cc forums.

I have put original sources of JPGAlleg 2.2 for those who are 
interested here: http://ufo2000.lxnt.info/files/jpgalleg-2.2.zip

The file 'fix8bit.patch' contains a patch with all the changes 
made to original JPGAlleg 2.2 sources.
