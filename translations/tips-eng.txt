## Basic usage of Ufo2000 (user-interface etc.) :
* You can use PageUp and PageDown keys to switch between levels.
* You can use the Tab key to jump to the next soldier both in battlescape view and in Unit editor.
* To open doors: right-click to turn the soldier towards the door, then right-click behind the door.
* You can use Arrow keys to scroll the battlescape view.
* Shift+Arrow keys change the size of the battlescape view, chat window and SHOW/HIDE minimap.
* You can show/hide the minimap and review previous chat or game messages by resizing the battlescape view.

## Advanced usage of Ufo2000:
* When moving, if you place the cursor on the map and hit Left Ctrl you will know how much TU's it costs to move the unit there.
* When aiming, hold Left Alt key to know if there's a valid line of sight between the soldier and the target.
* When throwing an object (such as a grenade), hold Left Alt to see how it will be thrown.
* To stop immediately a unit's movement, click the Right mouse button.
* To use precise aiming, hold Left Shift while firing a weapon.
* Kneeling gives your units more accuracy; moreover, they become harder to hit.
* Keeping time units allows a soldier to get a reaction fire on the first enemies he might "see".

## Weapons / Equipment / Units:
* A soldier's skin also effects his or her armour.
* Aliens don't wear armour.
* Don't forget ammo for your weapon.
* When editing soldiers' starting equipment, remember to load any weapons you add.
* For heavy weapons, like cannon and rocket-launcher, give extra ammo to another soldier.
* Throwing grenades requires airspace, otherwise they might hit the ceiling.
* The timer of grenades does not count down when you hold it in you hand.
* The timer on high explosives cannot be stopped after it is primed.
* Proximity mines explode when a unit steps into any of the tiles surrounding the mine's own.
* Smoke can last up to three turns.
* Notice that heavy plasma doesn't have auto-fire as it had in X-Com.
* When stun-damage goes above health, the soldier goes to sleep.
* Powerarmor and flying-armor are affected with stun-bombs just like any other skins.

## Terrain:
* Units tend to survive more if placed behind cover.
* Trying to fire a HE weapon through a window will most likely result in the shot exploding on the window.
* Grenades bounce downwards when attempting to throw them inside buildings with roofs.
* Use the minimap to have an idea of what your soldiers can see and cannot see. Check for dead angles and concealed areas.
* When looking downward from a higher level, the soldier's sight is limited.

## General Strategy & Tactic:
* Human players are smarter than the original game's AI.
* If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.
* The enemy attacks on two ocasions: when he's ready and when you are not.
* When your attack is going really well, it's an ambush.
* The enemy diversion you're ignoring is their main attack.
* A retreating enemy is probably just falling back and regrouping.
* The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is incoming friendly fire.
* Incoming fire has the right of way.
* You can't outrun plasma fire.
* If your ambush is properly set the enemy won't walk into it. 
* If the enemy is within range, so are you.
* Whenever you lose contact with the enemy, look behind you.
* Check your six o'clock!
* Don't look or act conspicuously; it draws fire.
* Don't get shot.
* No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.
* The enemy never watches until you make a mistake. 
* If your flank march is going well, the enemy expects you to outflank him.
* All warfare is based upon deception.
* Always pair up your soldiers. 
* Smoke blocks visibility both ways: your's and the enemy's.
* Look everywhere.
