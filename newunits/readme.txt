A directory with additional unit skins for use with UFO2000.

Currently all the files located here are contributed by Munkeylord
and are mostly taken from his XCWW2 mod at http://geocities.com/munkeylord/xcaddons.html

todo: add links to pck/spk editors that can be used to create 
      additional skins
