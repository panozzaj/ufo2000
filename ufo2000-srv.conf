# ufo2000 server config file
# 
# allowed options:
#  accept_user = name:password
#  reject_ip   = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx /x
#  accept_ip   = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx /x
#
# Note: accept_ip has higher priority than reject_ip
# So it is possible to have settings like this
#  reject_ip = 0.0.0.0 /0      # reject everyone
#  accept_ip = 127.0.0.0 /8    # accept localhost
#  accept_ip = 192.168.0.0 /16 # accept local network
