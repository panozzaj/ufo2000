                             Installing ufo2000.

1. General information.

Current ufo2000 version compiles and works well in UNIX and WIN32 enviroments. 
Previous version could also be compiled for DOS using DJGPP and a set of 
additional libraries (for more details download older sources 0.3.11 and 
look for instructions there). DOS support is not a primary target now though 
it still may be not completely broken. If anyone wants to reanimate 
DOS support, you are welcome.

To successfully run ufo2000 you need the following:
  1) ufo2000 executable itself. 
     You can download precompiled binary from ufo2000 home page or compile 
     the executable using the sources and instructions at the end of this file.

  2) ufo2000 data files.
     These files are free and are included both in source and binary distribution 
     archive and can be downloaded from ufo2000 home page.

  3) Data files from 'UFO: Enemy Unknown' by Microprose.
     These files are proprietary and are not distributed with the game.
     You have to get them from somewhere else. Currently ufo2000 runs well 
     with data files from 'UFO: Enemy Unknown V1.2' and 'UFO: Enemy Unknown V1.4'
     but other versions may work as well or may not.

After you get all the necessery files, create a directory for
ufo2000 and copy all the files there. All filenames must be converted to
lowercase to avoid problems in UNIX. You need GEODATA, GEOGRAPH, MAPS, 
SOUND, TERRAIN, UFOGRAPH, UFOINTRO, and UNITS directories from 
'UFO: Enemy Unknown'. Non proprietary data files from ufo2000 needed to play 
are the following: armoury.set, geodata.dat, items.dat, soldier.dat, 
ufo2000.dat and ufo2000.ini. Anyway if you are missing something, the program 
will tell you about this.
